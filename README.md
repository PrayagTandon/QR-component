## My process

1. Made a general.css file that consists the basic parameters that I set to build this website.

2. Followed the desktop-first approach to build the desktop version first and then used media query for the mobile layout.

3. Used relative units such as 'rem' throughout the project instead of absolute units such as px.

4. Made the image flexible by using percentage to define the width.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

1. Need to focus more on developing responsible layout.

2. Need to learn the proper usage of CSS grid and flexbox by doing more projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to learn different properties of CSS grid and when and how to use them.

- [Responsive Units](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-units-em-rem-vh-vw-with-code-examples/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the difference of usage between absolute and relative units.
